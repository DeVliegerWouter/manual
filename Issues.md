# Bugs and Features

## Bug reports for Rack

If you encounter a bug in Rack itself (not a plugin), such as a UI issue, broken functionality, hang, or crash, follow these steps.

- Log in or register for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- Search [Rack's issue tracker](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to check if someone else has posted a similar bug report.
	- If the bug is already reported, vote for it by adding a "thumb-up" reaction on the first post.
	- If not, [open a bug report issue](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) and fill out the issue template.

If you provide enough information for a developer to reproduce and identify the bug, a fix is then implemented, publicly tested with development builds, and released in a future Rack version.

## Bug reports and feature requests for Rack plugins

If a bug or feature request involves a particular plugin for Rack rather than Rack itself, follow these steps.

- Search for the plugin on the [VCV Library](https://vcvrack.com/plugins.html).
- If the plugin's source code is hosted on GitHub, open an issue.
- If not, use the provided contact information by clicking on the email icon or author's website.
